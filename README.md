Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.


## Model

Student describes their model in detail.
This includes the state, actuators and update equations.

## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration

Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep
length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values.
Additionally the student details the previous values tried.


## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing

A polynomial is fitted to waypoints.

If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or
actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.


## Model Predictive Control with Latency

The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency.
Student provides details on how they deal with latency.




## Simulation

The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.
